This is a solid project for your portfolio! Since you are a Computer Engineering student at IKU, having a professional, well-structured README is the best way to showcase your coding logic to future employers or professors.Here is a clean, modern, and professional README.md designed specifically for your GitHub repository.🚀 Office Hour Appointment SystemCSE2002 Project | 2023-2024A robust, file-based management system written in C to streamline the scheduling process between students and faculty. This project utilizes Linked Lists and Binary File I/O to manage office hours and appointments efficiently.📌 FeaturesThe system provides tailored functionalities for two types of users:👨‍🏫 For TeachersInsert Office Hours: Add new availability slots. The system automatically sorts them by ID using a linked list.Update Records: Modify the day, start time, or end time of existing slots.Persistent Storage: Save the entire schedule to a teacher-specific binary file (.dat) for data integrity.Inventory View: Print a clean, tabular summary of all currently registered office hours.🎓 For StudentsView Availability: Load a specific teacher's schedule from their records.Book Appointments: Search for a slot by ID and create a formal appointment.Appointment Logging: The system generates an appointment.txt file as a persistent record of the booking.🛠 Technical ImplementationThis project demonstrates several core Computer Engineering concepts:Data Structures: Custom struct definitions and dynamic Linked Lists for memory-efficient data management.File Handling: Implementation of both Binary (wb, rb) for data storage and Text file processing for logs.Sorting Algorithms: Insertion logic that maintains a sorted list based on id_number.Input Validation: Safe string handling via custom read_line functions to prevent buffer overflows.📂 Function OverviewFunctionDescriptioninsert_office_hourPrompts for details and performs a sorted insertion into the linked list.store_office_hourExports the linked list to a binary file named after the teacher.update_office_hourLocates a specific ID and allows modification of time/day.appointmentsClears the current list and populates it with data from a teacher's file.create_appointmentLinks a student name to a slot and appends it to the global log.read_lineA utility function for robust, null-terminated user input.🚀 How to RunClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/Ferdaws-c/Office-Hour-Appointment-system-CSE2002_Project_2023-2024-.git
Compile the code:Use any C compiler (GCC recommended):Bashgcc main.c -o office_system
Execute:Bash./office_system
